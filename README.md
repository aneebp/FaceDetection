# Real-Time Face Detection using MediaPipe and OpenCV

This Python script demonstrates real-time face detection using the MediaPipe library and OpenCV. It captures video from a file named 'face.mp4' and draws bounding boxes around detected faces. Additionally, it calculates and displays the frames per second (FPS) processed.

## Libraries Used

OpenCV: Used for capturing and processing video frames.
MediaPipe: Provides face detection functionality.
